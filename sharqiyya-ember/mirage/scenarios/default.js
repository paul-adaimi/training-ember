    details:`A dance performance by Ali Chahrour
January 24 to 27, 2019 - Al Madina Theatre, Beirut

Night is a dance concert whose approach and aesthetics draw their inspiration from the dense archive of love and romance in classical Arabic poetry and from contemporary  stories of lovers and their cruel separation.

This work references stories from the cultural memory of the Levant and Mesopotamia among others, about the fate of lovers who challenged social and religious systems, and whose bodies were punished and sentenced to suffer the distance of separation as well as the hope of impossible reunions.

The performance records the vicissitudes of lovers and their resistance, leading up to the moment when they fall and fade away. The exhausted body succumbs, and with it falls every action and instrument/tools that the performers had carried throughout the show. The fall reveals the fragility of the lover/performer, and the frailty of all the methods and tools at his disposal. The stage becomes the battlefield after the battle, where the audience has just witnessed the death, or rather, the birth of its heroes.
